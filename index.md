## Yukon University - Virtual Field School

### Background and Goals
The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred the development of online virtual geology field trips as an educational resource across North America. These field trips serve to build public awareness of earth sciences and provide virtual access to remote locations and information in an engaging format. The recent Yukon Mineral Development Strategy (2021) highlighted the need for greater community geoscience awareness and education in the public school system.  

Yukon University is developing a series of regional virtual field trips which will showcase Yukon's spectacular geology. It will show how the mineral resource industry has shaped our past and present, and the dynamic nature of our northern environment. The objective of the project is increase the awareness of educators, students, and citizens in Yukon of Yukonâ€™s unique geological regions and features.  The project team will work in partnership with community stakeholders to develop a robust suite of virtual field trips and complementary educational products. The development of tools and guidelines for educators to integrate these resources into their curriculums a critical success factor of the project.
